# Winter Rock Operations - Analysis 


Overview

This project analyzes Winter Rock's sales trends, forecasting, distribution optimization, and new product launch strategies using advanced data analytics techniques. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to optimize operations for the next winter season.

üìä Key Topics Covered

- Sales Trends Analysis:

1. Investigated time-series data to identify seasonal patterns.
2. Used 12-month centered moving average (CMA-12) for trend smoothing.

- Sales Forecasting:

1. Applied Single Exponential Smoothing (SES) for sales prediction.
2. Evaluated error metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

- Distribution Plan Optimization:

1. Used Linear Programming (LP) to minimize distribution costs.
2.  Optimized shipments from Manchester & London distribution centers.

- New Product Demand Planning:

1. Developed a Decision Tree Model to compare supplier options.
2. Conducted Monte Carlo Simulation to assess profitability.
   
## üìà Key Findings & Recommendations

1Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Trends & Seasonality

‚úî Sales peak in October - December, aligning with the winter sports season.

‚úî CMA-12 analysis confirms a strong upward trend in sales.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Forecasting & Accuracy

‚úî SES model predicts stable sales but struggles with seasonality.

‚úî Optimal alpha value (Œ± = 0.2) ensures balance between bias and accuracy.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimized Distribution Plan

‚úî The Manchester center ships 2000 units, London handles 2200 units.

‚úî This minimizes total shipping costs to ¬£99,615.

4Ô∏è‚É£ New Product Supplier Decision

‚úî Decision Tree & Monte Carlo Simulation favor the USA supplier.

‚úî Expected profit = ¬£35,000, higher than the European supplier.

‚úî Winter Rock should consider risk mitigation strategies before finalizing.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how data analytics can drive operational efficiency. The optimized distribution plan and supplier selection provide a roadmap for Winter Rock to reduce costs and increase profitability.
